Nails. They come in hundreds of sizes, weights, materials, and shapes. Roofing nails, ring shank nails, finishing nails, new nails still in their box, rusted and bent nails pulled from pallets. I love how one ordinary object like a nail seems like trash, or maybe a future flat tire, but hundreds of nails in careful arrangement with wood is a roof, a wall, a visually satisfying piece of art.
