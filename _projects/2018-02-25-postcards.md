Apps like Facebook and Instagram help us passively keep up with our friends, but easily become a meaningless endless scroll. What does it look like to pictorially update friends and family, on a semi-regular basis? I started drawing postcards as an answer to my mom's questions- "how come you never call me?" and "why didn't you take more pictures?!". The first postcards were tiny visual updates arranged in a rough timeline of events, hand-drawn on thick watercolor paper and mailed off back home. These days my mailing list is longer, and while I still try to capture something relevant to my life, the focus is much smaller. I usually draw each card using micron pens, then scan them and do some cleanup before printing them at home.
