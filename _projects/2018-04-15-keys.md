Keys! We carry them everywhere, and use them to access private spaces and belongings. What else can we do with these humble objects? In 2013 I traded sauerkraut to a third generation locksmith for the ability to rummage through his castoff key bucket. He was so charmed with my excitement he also sent me home with a box of antique keys and blanks, including some from a company that went out of business in the 1920's. I'm still working my way through that box, making chimes, jewelry, and sculpture.

Some of this work appeared at the Santa Cruz Museum and Art and History as part of a group show in 2013.
