    caption: When we first arrived, we had a blank slate- open playa in almost every direction.

    caption: Carefully aligning the beams for the tower. We built the temple in chunks on the ground, then used a crane to lift each piece.
  - sunset:

    caption: We worked 12 hour days, from sunrise to beyond sunset.
  - eclipse:

    caption: We missed the totality, but the eclipse was around 85% where we were. We caught it in the middle of a big crane pick. We happened to have a solar scientist on the crew who came loaded with glasses, but I also had welding faceplates from my dad.

    caption: Our progress meant every sunset revealed new lines and shadows. It also meant dinner time, which after a long day in the sun sounded pretty great.

    caption: Cantilevered beams looked beautiful in the drawings, but turned out to be tricky with damp and twisted wood.

In 2017 I spent months working with a volunteer crew to build a 70ft tall temple in the middle of desert, then burn it to the ground. The temple means something different for everyone, but most agree it's a place to grieve, and release the things we carry.

<br>

This temple consisted of beetle-killed pine donated by a utility company, and an absurd amount of very large screws. The geometric design meant hours in blazing sun and 100+ degree temperatures stacking and re-stacking 6x6 beams until they were perfectly aligned, to create lines and shapes that flowed from the base to the top seven stories above. After we completed building, we turned the structure over to the city, who created hundreds of altars, memorials, and art pieces to add to the piece. Unlike other burns, the temple burn is largely silent, and gives us all a chance to release the emotion and energy built up over its construction.
