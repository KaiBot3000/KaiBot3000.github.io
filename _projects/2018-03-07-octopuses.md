I completed my first octopus in a manic 5 hours of straight sewing, complete with eight ballet slippers and a tutu. Legs was my first octopus, but he was the start of something big. Since then I've made octopuses for wedding presents (embroidered with the anniversary), octopuses for babies (including a rattle inside), and octopuses for travel pals. Octopuses for fundraisers. Octopuses for sad friends. Octopuses for teaching how to sew. Pretty much every occasion warrants an octo-pal, if you're looking at it right.

This collection is incomplete, unfortunately, but it's also always growing.
