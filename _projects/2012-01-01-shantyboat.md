Starting in 2012 I spent nights and weekends building a flat-bottomed river boat in a friend's backyard, based on designs developed by people living on rivers in the early 1900's. In 2014 we launched the Dotty went on her maiden voyage, floating down the upper reaches of the Mississippi.

My then-partner turned it into his masters' thesis and eventually an ongoing project, which is documented at [peoplesriverhistory.us](peoplesriverhistory.us).
