At any given time I have something like 100k organisms under my care, and about half of those are European honey bees. I started keeping backyard bees in 2015 by trading 20lbs of sauerkraut for a locally caught swarm. Since then, I've learned about everything from bees' social structure to genetics, mostly through internet fora and local beekeeping associations. California's intense drought combined with my casual approach means I don't get a ton of honey, but I get enough honey, wax, and propolis to make salves, candles, and mead for myself and friends. More than the products they produce, I love being close to a deadly and complicated organism whose history is so closely intertwined with that of humans.
